# 🎙️ Image → Text → Audio Converter  

Turn **images into voices**! 🖼️➡️📖➡️🔊  
This project extracts text from images and then transforms it into natural-sounding speech — making information **accessible, interactive, and fun**.

## 🚀 Features  
✨ **OCR-powered**: Reads text from any image using state-of-the-art recognition.  
✨ **Text-to-Speech**: Converts recognized text into clear, human-like audio.  
✨ **Multi-purpose**: Useful for accessibility, audiobook generation, education, and quick image-to-voice interactions.  
✨ **Notebook-based**: Easy to experiment with, extend, and adapt inside Jupyter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 🐍**  
- **Jupyter Notebook 📒**  
- **OCR Engine (like Tesseract / EasyOCR)**  
- **Text-to-Speech (gTTS / pyttsx3 / other TTS APIs)**  
- **PIL / OpenCV** for image processing
